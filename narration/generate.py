"""
Render the Pulse's narration to audio, once, at build time.

Every spoken line in PULSE 01 is fixed, so there is no reason to pay for it or
wait on it at runtime. This writes public/narration/<lang>/<id>.wav; the app
plays those files and only falls back to the browser's speech engine if one is
missing.

The model behind this is a chat model wearing a TTS hat, and it is not
deterministic. Left alone it will introduce itself, answer an Indonesian
question instead of reading it, drift into a different register, or return a
take padded with several seconds of dead air. So this script does not "call a
TTS API" — it auditions takes:

    render one  ->  score it  ->  keep it or try again

A take is accepted only when the transcript matches the script word for word,
the pace sits inside a believable speaking range, the level is healthy, and
there is no long silence buried in the middle of it. Accepted audio is then
trimmed of leading/trailing dead air, given a short fade at both ends, and
normalised so no line arrives louder than its neighbour. That last part is what
makes the narration feel like one person in one room rather than 36 separate
API calls.

Usage (from the project root):
    python narration/generate.py                  # only missing files
    python narration/generate.py --force          # re-render everything
    python narration/generate.py --lang id        # one language
    python narration/generate.py --only enter-1 morning
    python narration/generate.py --voice sage
    python narration/generate.py --attempts 8     # audition harder
    python narration/generate.py --level-only     # just re-level what exists

The OpenRouter key comes from the environment (so `bws run -- python
narration/generate.py` works), falling back to narration/.env, which is
gitignored. Never hardcoded, never committed.
